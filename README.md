## About The Project

There are many great React boilerplate templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one.

To do so I used Vite - Typescript - Redux - Redux Toolkit - RTK query for fetching data.
Ps: This project includes also dark mode and configured i18n to support english and french!

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different.

### Prerequisites

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_To use this template_

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AzerKhamassi/lazer-app.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Enter your API in `.env`
   ```js
   const VITE_REACT_APP_URL = 'ENTER YOUR BACKEND URL';
   ```
4. Run the project
